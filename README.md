# AlgoU Online Judge

**AlgoU** is an **Online Judge platform** built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It supports coding problems with automatic code evaluation, problem management, AI review and leaderboard functionality.

## Overview

**AlgoU** enables:

- **User Registration and Login** with JWT-based authentication
- **Problem Listing** with filtering options
- **Code Submission** with real-time verdict feedback
- **Leaderboard Tracking** based on user performance
- **User Profiles** displaying past submissions

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Code Evaluation**: Docker containers 

---

## Architecture Overview  
AlgoU Online Judge follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern to ensure clean separation of concerns and maintainable code structure.

## MVC Implementation  
**Model Layer (Database & Data Logic)**  
  
User Model: Handles user authentication, profiles, and submissions  
Problem Model: Manages coding problems, test cases, and metadata  
Discussion Model: Manages problem discussions, comments, and community interactions  
  
**Routes Layer (API Endpoints)**  
  
Auth Routes: User authentication and authorization endpoints   
User Routes: User profile management and statistics  
Community Routes: Discussion forums and community interactions  
Problem Routes: Problem CRUD operations and submissions  
  
**Controller Layer (Backend API Logic)**
   
User Controller: Manages user profiles, statistics, and submissions  
Auth Controller: Handles login, registration, and JWT verification  
  
**View Layer (Frontend/React Components)**  
  
Problem List View: Displays available coding problems  
Code Editor View: Interactive code submission interface  
Profile View: User dashboard and submission history  
Leaderboard View: Real-time rankings and statistics

## System Workflow

1. **User submits code** through the platform
2. **Worker service** runs the code inside a **Docker container**.
3. Output is **compared with expected results** stored in the database.
4. **Verdict** is stored and shown on the frontend.

---

## Security Measures

- **Docker sandboxing** for safe and isolated execution
- **JWT Authentication**
- **Input validation** and escaping to prevent injection attacks

---

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

   [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) *(or the port shown in your terminal)*

---

### Backend Setup

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

    ```env
    MONGO=your_mongo_uri
    JWT_SECRET='...'
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 📡 API Endpoints

- `GET /` – Health check endpoint  
- `POST /run` – Execute code with input  
  **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "language": "string",
    "code": "string",
    "input": "string"
  }
  ```

- `POST /ai-review` – Get AI feedback on code  
  **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "code": "string"
  }
  ```

---

## 🐳 Docker Support

The backend includes Docker configuration for containerized deployment.

1. **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

2. **Run on PORT:**

    ```bash
    (http://localhost:5173)
    ```
3. **To stop the containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Best Practices Implemented  
**Code Organization**  
  
Separation of Concerns: Clear distinction between frontend, backend, and database layers  
Modular Structure: Components and services are organized in logical modules  
RESTful API Design: Consistent and intuitive endpoint naming conventions  
  
**Security Best Practices**    
  
Environment Variables: Sensitive data stored in .env files  
Input Sanitization: All user inputs are validated and sanitized  
Authentication Middleware: JWT-based route protection  
Docker Isolation: Code execution in sandboxed containers  
CORS Configuration: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup  
  
**Performance Optimization**  
  
Database Indexing: Optimized queries with proper indexing  
Caching Strategy: Redis implementation for frequently accessed data  
Code Splitting: Frontend bundle optimization with lazy loading  
Connection Pooling: Efficient database connection management  
  
**Development Practices**  
  
Version Control: Git workflow with meaningful commit messages  
Error Handling: Comprehensive error catching and logging  
Code Documentation: Inline comments and README documentation  
Testing Strategy: Unit and integration tests for critical components  
  
**Deployment & DevOps**  
  
Containerization: Docker for consistent deployment environments  
Environment Configuration: Separate configs for development, testing, and production  
Monitoring & Logging: Application performance monitoring setup  
CI/CD Pipeline: Automated testing and deployment workflows
